**Task Description: RESTful Library Inventory API**

**Objective:**
Design and develop a **RESTful API** for a **library inventory system** that allows users to perform **CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete)** operations on book records using **Node.js**, **Express**, and **MongoDB**.

---

### Key Features:

* **Add a new book** to the inventory
* **View all books** or a **specific book** by ID
* **Update book details** (e.g., title, author, genre)
* **Delete a book** from the inventory
* Proper error handling for invalid requests

---

### Tools & Technologies:

* **Backend:** Node.js, Express.js
* **Database:** MongoDB with Mongoose
* **Testing Tools:** Postman or curl
* **Data Format:** JSON

---

### Sample Book Data:

```json
{
  "title": "Clean Code",
  "author": "Robert C. Martin",
  "year": 2008,
  "genre": "Software Engineering",
  "available": true
}
```

---

### Deliverables:

* Fully functional API code with modular structure
*  API documentation listing all endpoints and their usage
*  Sample test data for API requests

 **Conclusion**

The RESTful Library Inventory API provides a complete backend solution for managing a collection of books using standard CRUD operations. Built with **Node.js**, **Express**, and **MongoDB**, the API is modular, scalable, and easy to integrate with any frontend or third-party system.

Through clearly defined endpoints, it enables users to create, retrieve, update, and delete book records efficiently. The use of **JSON format**, **Mongoose models**, and **Express routing** ensures maintainable and readable code.

This API serves as a strong foundation for building more advanced features in the future, such as user authentication, book lending history, search filters, and pagination. It demonstrates a solid understanding of REST principles and backend development practices.
